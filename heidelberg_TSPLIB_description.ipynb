    "# Heidelberg problem set\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "TSPLIB is a library of sample instances for the Travelling Salesman Problems (and related problems) from various sources and of various types. There problem instances in different classes available, but **in this project we focus on problems in classes TSP and ATSP**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Current implementation\n",
    "We are able to import TSP problems for wich the distances are of type EUC_2D [e.g a280]. Implementation of problems of types GEO [e.g. gr96], and MATRIX [e.g. gr17] should be strightforwards, and we'll work on them next. Implementation of ATSP should also be possiblem, but it requires a few modifications to the class methods, namely introducing a \"symmetric\" parameter in the ``graph`` class generator. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Graph type, distance type\n",
    "For our choice of classes, all problems are defined on a complete graph and all distances are integer numbers.\n",
