# TSProject
Our project structure:

1. **TSProject/graph_class.py**-> a library that maintain all main operations with garph creation (distance calculation, graph composition, adjacency matrix creation).
2. **TSProject/WALKTHROUGH_graph_class.ipynb**-> a notebook that explains step-by-step usage of graph_class.py.
3. **TSProject/tests/**-> a notebook for testing graph_class.py.

4. **TSProject/heidelberg_TSPLIB_description.ipynb**-> a TSPLIB datasets explanation and details.
5. **TSProject/algorithms/Notebooks_with_algorithms/**-> a folder that consist of all algorithms with appropriate testing in jupyter notebook format. Ready to be used for evaluation.

6. **TSProject/algorithms/**-> a folder that consist of all algorithms in .py files. Those files are used for global benchmarking.
7. **TSProject/benchmarking/**-> a benchmarking jupyter notebook is placed there. Ready to be used for evaluation.
8. **TSProject/data/**-> all datasets that were used for testing and benchmarking are placed in this folder.
9. **TSProject/examples/**->a notebook with algorithms testing examples.
10. **TSProject/plots/**-> plots obtained during evaluation.
11. **TSProject/results/**-> benchmarking and testing results are placed in this folder.
